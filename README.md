### ● Input box
Similar to [batchlink](https://github.com/etherealxx/batchlinks-webui), you use tag then URL:

```python
$tag
URL
```
Tag should begin with " $ "<br>
Tag is mandatory and there is no default path.<br>
For available tags, refer to the [Tag List] at the bottom of the extension.<br>
![taglist](https://github.com/gutris1/sd-hub/assets/132797949/4e08189c-9617-4681-8985-38cbfd5acb2e)

You can also add subdirectories to the tag if you have any:
```python
$ckpt/tmp_ckpt
https://civitai.com/api/download/models/403131
```

To add an optional path:
```python
$ckpt
https://civitai.com/api/download/models/403131 /kaggle/working/stable-diffusion-webui/zzzzz
```

To download with custom filename, add " - " after the URL or optional path (if provided):
```python
# Without optional path
$ckpt
https://civitai.com/api/download/models/403131 - imagine-anime-XL.safetensors

# With optional path
$ckpt
https://civitai.com/api/download/models/403131 /kaggle/working/stable-diffusion-webui/zzzzz - imagine-anime-XL.safetensors
```

### ● Token box

For Huggingface repository:<br>
Press the Scrape Button to return a list of URLs that match these extensions (.safetensors .bin .pth .pt .ckpt .yaml)<br>
Paste the repository URL in the following format:<br>

```python
# To scrape everything in the branch tree list (folders and subfolders won't be included)
htttps://huggingface.co/user_name/repo_name/tree/branch_name

# To Scrape a folder
htttps://huggingface.co/user_name/repo_name/tree/branch_name/folder

# or
htttps://huggingface.co/user_name/repo_name/tree/branch_name/folder/sub_folder
```
Enter your Hugginface READ token into Token box if you want to Scrape your private repo.<br>

And Pastebin:<br>
Simply paste the pastebin URL<br>
```python
https://pastebin.com/696969
```
And it will return a list of whatever is available at the pastebin URL you just input.<br>
If it has a hashtag from batchlink, it will automatically be replaced with SD-Hub Tags.<br>

### ● Insert TXT Button
To upload a TXT file from your device, simply select it and upload it into the input box.<br>

$ckpt - my-merge

/kaggle/working/stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion/animagineXLV31_v31.safetensors

# with tag
$ckpt/animagineXLV31_v31.safetensors

# to rename the uploaded file
